This folder contains a sample movie made with firedpy out put made for
the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

To recreate these images with QGIS:

1) download the QGIS Time Manager plugin zip file from this url:

   https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/timemanager/.

2) On the top menu:
 select Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins... > Install from ZIP >
    Local zip file > Install Plugin.

3) Load the daily geopackage from the desired firedpy model run
   (found in "<proj_dir>/outputs/shapefiles/<file_name>_daily.gpkg")

4) In the layers menu, right click the geopackage entry, then select:
   properties > symbology > "categorized" (top dropdown) > column >
   "id" > coloramp > "random" > classify (below symbol box) > apply  
   (this may take some time) > symbol > "simple fill" >  stroke style >
   "No Pen" > OK > OK

5) If that worked open the Time Manager Plugin. Click the power button
   if that isn't green already, under "Time Manager Settings" add a
   layer, select the "date" field for the start period, click
   click the "Time Display Options" button, choose the correct date format
   in the "DateTime" input box and adjust other settings to format details.
   When you are finished with this portal, enter the "Export Video"
   portal, set the target directory for the images. In one of these options
   you will be able to aggregate the shape, so do that or most fires will 
   appear and disappear to quickly to see. Exit this portal to trigger the
   build and wait.
